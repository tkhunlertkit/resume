\section{Work History}

\entry
	{Johnson Control International}
	{}
	{November 2018 - Present}
	{Milwaukee, WI}
	{
		Develop algorithms and cloud application running on the Nexsys cloud service. The application implements model predictive controls in an attempt to predict and control the temperature set points of the building with the constraint to maximize the savings of resource costs. My primary contributions include implementation of the logic to control roof top unit systems written in C\#. In an extension to the project, data science platform is being develop in Python, in an attempt to reduce the required knowledge of a query language. The main objective of the platform is to retrieve the data from the database where users can ask the question as an English language.
	}

\entry
	{Mitel Networks Corporation}
	{}
	{Summer 2018}
	{Milwaukee, WI}
	{
		Developed Internet Of Things platform as a service. The platform allows users to create a network of devices that send data to the server and sends alerts if the reading values exceed a certain threshold. My primary contributions include analysis rules platform that can be configured by the user for devices to be evaluated when the server received the data. 
	}
